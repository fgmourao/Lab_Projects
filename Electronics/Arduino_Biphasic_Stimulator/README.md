# Biphasic square waves trigger for periodic electrical stimulation 
 
The digital signal is generated through an Arduino with programmable attributes such as wavelengths and interpulse intervals. This signal from Arduino is decoupled through a simple circuit formed by a Optocoupler to drive electrical stimulators with a variable amplitude.

Extra digital outputs are used to reproduce the generated signal, which allows the recording of events and a visual feedback through an LED.

# Biphasic square waves for periodic electrical stimulation 
 
The digital signal is generated through an Arduino with programmable attributes such as wavelengths and interpulse intervals. This signal from Arduino is decoupled through a simple circuit formed by a Optocoupler with a variable amplitude. 

Extra digital outputs are used to reproduce the generated time events and to allow visual feedback through an LED.

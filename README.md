The relevance of sensory cues constantly changes in natural environments, and the adaptive behavior of animals depends on their ability to dynamically modulate the encoding of relevant stimuli. During auditory perception, the coordinated activity of the neuronal assemblies encoding acoustic stimuli results in oscillatory patterns of local field potential (LFP). Over the last several years, it has been reported that auditory learning modifies the encoding of behaviorally relevant sounds and influences LFP oscillations in different auditory brain areas. In auditory fear conditioning (AFC), pairing an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) with a foot shock modifies the neural oscillations in the brain areas involved in CS processing.

Much of the recent effort to understand the underpinnings of this constructive nature of perception has been put into the modulation exerted by the cortex into the thalamus and/or limbic areas. However, some features of the incoming stimuli are processed in the very first stages of the sensory pathway, some of them being the target of robust efferent projections from higher-level processing areas and being subjected to task-related plastic changes. 

In this sense, we propose to analyze the relationships between multiple brain substrates along the acoustic pathway involved in different stages of auditory perception.

Midbrain local field potential oscillations follow the amplitude envelope of an amplitude-modulated tone, originating a neural response called the steady-state evoked potential.
